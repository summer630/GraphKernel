=== Introduction ===

This folder contains Matlab scripts: WL.m, WLedge.m, and WLspdelta.m
WL.m computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel
WLedge.m computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman edge kernel
WLspdelta.m computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman shortest path kernel (with 
exact matching of shortest path lengths)
on graphs with unweighted unlabeled edges, with/without node labels.

=== Usage ===

For each script X.m, the Matlab command
  help X
will display instructions on how to use the script X.m
